# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

In this assignment, I developed a program to determining the amount of people who may retire or should be asked to retire this year based off certain parameters given to me, such as date of birth. In this assignment, I used pgAdmin to manipulate and create universal csv (excel files) with all the information needed to make accurate retirement suggestions. With this challenge, there were many different spreadsheets with only a tiny bit of information in each one of them. To get a better scope of the project I was working on, I created an Employee Database which linked the similarities in each of the datasets. These results are shown below.
